# ADR-016: Dark Theme Refinement

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Context
The current dark theme is "flashy" with high contrast elements that don't create the professional, subtle experience desired. Users want a more muted, subtle dark theme that maintains consistency throughout the app while feeling seamless and professional.

## Decision
Implement a refined dark theme with:
- More muted color palettes
- Reduced contrast ratios for less flashiness
- Consistent subtle styling across all components
- Professional appearance while maintaining readability
- Seamless integration with existing design system

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Professional appearance, better user comfort
- **Negative**: Requires careful color balance adjustments
- **Neutral**: Improves overall app polish

## Implementation Plan
1. Analyze current theme variables and color usage
2. Design new muted color palette
3. Update CSS custom properties for subtle contrasts
4. Refine button, modal, and component styling
5. Ensure accessibility standards are maintained
6. Test theme consistency across all pages
7. Validate readability and user experience
